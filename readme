# Star Wars Flutter Project

## Overview

The Star Wars Flutter Project is a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework. It provides information about Star Wars movies, including details such as titles, release dates, directors, and more.

## Project Structure

The project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, which promotes separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. The codebase is organized into different layers:

1. **Presentation Layer:**
   - Located in the `presenter` directory.
   - Contains the UI components, screens, and controllers.
   - Uses the GetX package for state management.

2. **Domain Layer:**
   - Located in the `domain` directory.
   - Represents the business logic and use cases of the application.
   - Contains entities, use cases, and repositories.

3. **Data Layer:**
   - Located in the `data` directory.
   - Handles data retrieval and storage.
   - Utilizes models and repositories for data management.
   - Integrates with external data sources 

4. **Dependency Injection (DI):**
   - Dependency injection is implemented using the GetIt package.
   - Services and dependencies are registered and injected where needed.

## Clean Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - Each layer has a distinct responsibility, making the codebase modular and maintainable.

2. **Dependency Rule:**
   - Dependencies point inwards. Outer layers are dependent on inner layers.
   - Core business logic is independent of external frameworks and libraries.

3. **Testability:**
   - Business logic is isolated in the domain layer, making it easy to test without UI dependencies.

## Project state manager

The project is developed using GetX state management.
